<main>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Methodology Used</h2>
        <p>We continued to strictly follow <strong>Agile Scrum</strong> for Sprint 3. The team focused on planning, execution, and review cycles while ensuring transparency, accountability, and proper task management.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Sprint Planning</h2>
        <p>Sprint 3 planning involved setting clear goals and assigning tasks to individual team members using <strong>Notion</strong>. Each task had defined deliverables and acceptance criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Backlog items were reviewed and refined before the sprint</li>
            <li>Tasks were assigned to specific team members with priorities and estimated effort</li>
            <li>Dependencies and blockers were identified early</li>
            <li>GitHub was used to manage repository branches, issues, and pull requests for each task</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Daily Stand-ups</h2>
        <p>We held daily meetings via video calls to provide updates and maintain team alignment. Each member shared:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tasks completed the previous day</li>
            <li>Tasks planned for the current day</li>
            <li>Any blockers or issues needing team attention</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This practice helped reduce confusion and kept the sprint on track.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Task Tracking</h2>
        <p>All tasks were tracked in <strong>Notion</strong> using a workflow board with the following stages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To Do</li>
            <li>In Progress</li>
            <li>Review / Testing</li>
            <li>Done</li>
        </ul>
        <p>GitHub was used to track code changes, manage pull requests, and review commits. This ensured accountability and traceability of all changes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Evidence & References</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sprint planning, task tracking, and daily stand-ups were documented in our <a href="YOUR_NOTION_LINK_HERE" target="_blank">Notion workspace</a></li>
            <li>All code-related changes were tracked via GitHub repository commit logs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Proof of our Sprint 3 meetings:</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>Strictly following Agile Scrum in Sprint 3 ensured that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We delivered incremental working features consistently</li>
            <li>User feedback could be incorporated quickly into development cycles</li>
            <li>Transparency and task accountability were maintained using Notion and GitHub</li>
            <li>The methodology was followed strictly, providing clear evidence of process adherence</li>
        </ul>
